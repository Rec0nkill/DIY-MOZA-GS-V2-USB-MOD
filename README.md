# DIY-MOZA-GS-V2-USB-MOD
Made this page to collect information on how to mod a MOZA GS V2 wheel (now called GS GT by MOZA)

For starters I wrote some general instructions in a PDF format, more information will follow as things progress


### Current issues & things to improve:

- USB Power stability
  
  The hub uses USB 2.0, meaning 2.5W max for power, so 0.5A at 5V.

  When the hub gets less than around 1.5W of power it shuts down. Depending on the USB cable length used and the port its plugged into, the hub ends up getting under 1.5W.

   That's why Moza added the auxiliry USB port (the USB-C port) this stabilises the power and the problem is resolved.

  With the hub being in the wheel, the goal is to only run one 4-wire cable to the wheel. This means one cable for each port is not possible. For now I get around this issue by plugging into a powered hub and using a relativly short not coiled cable, but I want to find a more suitible solution in the future.

## USB Mod with stock external hub (identical to the way the FSR or KS wheel from Moza work on the hub)
